# Raylab — GPU Ray Tracing & Optical Simulation (NumPy + CuPy)

### Overview
**Raylab** is an interactive, GPU-accelerated notebook environment for exploring the fundamentals of **scientific visualization, ray tracing, and optical interference**.  
Built on **NumPy** and **CuPy**, it demonstrates how core physical and mathematical simulations can transition seamlessly from CPU to GPU computation.

The notebook guides users step-by-step through building a minimal yet powerful GPU ray tracer and optical simulation toolkit.



## Core Learning Goals

- Understand the differences between **CPU (NumPy)** and **GPU (CuPy)** computing  
- Learn **CUDA acceleration concepts** via Python  
- Implement vectorized GPU kernels for light transport  
- Explore **ray tracing**, **diffraction**, and **wave interference** through visual examples
